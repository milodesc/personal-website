A certain top-hatted president once said: "I like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives. I like to see a man live so that his place will be proud of him."<br><br>

I aim to be the type of person Lincoln would like to see.  By advocating for effective city planning, sustainable transportation, and the appropriate use of technology, I believe I can help shape places into something I am proud of while gaining the pride of the places I shape.
