    <p>transalt.org is Transportation Alternatives' online hub for getting New Yorkers involved in the fight to reclaim their city's streets from the automobile. Built on the Drupal platform, it provides opportunities to learn about the organization's mission and ways to get involved. I've created new pages, Drupal content types and views, partially re-themed the site and participated in many other development and maintenance projects.</p>
