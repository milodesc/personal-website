I am currently the author of 2 blogs:<br><br>The first, <a href="http://www.improvingtheinherited.com" target="new">Improving the Inherited</a>, is concerned with asking (and sometimes answering) the questions pertinent to improving the built environment inherited from previous generations.<br><br>

The second, <a href="http://greentransportmetuchen.wordpress.com" target="new">Green Transport Metuchen</a>, is concerned with celebrating and promoting sustainable tranportation in my hometown, Metuchen, NJ.
